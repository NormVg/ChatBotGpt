            "a": " Yea, me too. I feel like God often puts strangers in front of you, and gives you an opportunity to connect with them in that moment in deeply meaningful ways. Do you ever feel like you know things about strangers without them telling you?"

            "q": " what do you mean?",
            "a": " I think it's like a 6th sense, often seen as \"cold readings\" to people, but can be remarkably accurate. I once sat next to a man in a coffee and I felt a pain in my back. I asked the stranger if he had a pain. It turns out that he did in the exact spot, and said he pulled a muscle while dancing at a party. I had never met the man before and never saw him again."

            "a": " There's this practice called \"Treasure Hunting\" that's kind of a fun game you play in a public place. There's a book called \"The Ultimate Treasure Hunt\" that talks about it. You use your creativity to imagine people you will meet, and you write down a description, then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word. Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea, sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day, and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love."

For a while I would go to the farmers market in Santa Cruz every week and try to feel if there is something I am supposed to tell a stranger. Usually, they are vague hope-filled messages, but it's weird when I blurt out something oddly specific."

            "a": " it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature"

            "q": " lol Sorry to hear that. Are you planning anything fun for December?",
            "a": " Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick."

      },
      {
            "q": " lol this is the first time I heard from a boy who cares about humidity and lotion. I cannot agree more.",
            "a": " Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day."

            "q": " Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?",
            "a": " Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax."
      },
      {
            "q": " Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.",
            "a": " Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!"
      },
      {
            "q": " I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?",
            "a": " Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome.."
      },

            "a": " Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive."
      },
      {
            "q": " I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.",
            "a": " Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year."
      },
      {
            "q": " I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?",
            "a": " Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do."
      },
      {
            "q": " I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?",
            "a": " Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals."
      },
      {
            "q": " Ah that's great. My wife also likes Target a lot. She even made a Target credit card because she comes to that store very often. Okay thanks for the suggestion. I'll check out Target.",

      {
            "q": " Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?",

      },
      {
            "q": " I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?",
            "a": " Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?"
      },
      {
            "q": " Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.",
            "a": " Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?"
      },
      {
            "q": " The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.",

      },
      {
            "q": " Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?",
            "a": " yes"
      },
      {
            "q": " Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila",
            "a": " Hehe, i think you should publish this someday :)"
      },

For example, there's this ice cream brand called <REDACTED_TERM>. It's only 320 calories a pint. And yes, it preserves most of the normal sweet flavors.",

            "q": " Interesting. I heard about the sweet substitute in a program called the Keto diet. Basically, we try to limit our sugar intake every day. Successful Keto dieters have recommended the <REDACTED_TERM> ice cream to fill their insatiable crave for sugar.",

To be honest, I don't really know what really happened versus what my parents want people to think. I just know that one minute I was in the US, and then they put me on a plane to Taiwan, and I never saw my stuff again. In some ways, it made me more sentimental.

            "a": " well, it's like a cage match of tennis. The main difference is that both players play in the same 'court' and the ball is smashed against a wall instead of passing it over a net into the opponent's court. Kind of like playing pingpong vs the table."
      },
      {
            "q": " Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?",
            "a": " it depends haha, there is a lot of bumping into each other to run after the ball, and sometimes the ball hits you too. Overall it feels like a super fast paced version of tennis, really tiring!"
      },
      {
            "q": " That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!",

      },
      {
            "q": " Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.",
            "a": " Yes, it's the same philosophy. You seem to know a lot about mountain climbing. Do you climb a lot?"
      },
      {
            "q": " I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?",
